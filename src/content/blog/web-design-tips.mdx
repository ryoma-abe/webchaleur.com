# Creating Human-Centered Web Design

Modern websites often feel cold and impersonal. Here's how to add warmth.

## Design Principles

### 1. Embrace Imperfection
Use slightly irregular border-radius and subtle rotations.

### 2. Natural Colors
Avoid pure white and black. Use warm off-whites and soft grays.

### 3. Handwritten Fonts
Consider fonts like Klee One or Zen Maru Gothic for a personal touch.

### 4. Staggered Animations
Add slight delays to create natural movement.

### 5. Human Elements
Include staff photos, handwritten messages, and local imagery.

## Implementation Tips

```css
/* Warm colors */
--bg-cream: #fefdfb;
--text-dark: #2c2825;
```

## Conclusion

By adding these human touches, websites become more inviting and memorable.
